            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An ACCOUNT of the PROCEEDINGS AT THE Kings-Bench Bar AT WESTMINSTER-HALL, Againſt the SEVEN BISHOPS.</head>
            <p>ON <hi>Friday</hi> being the firſt day of the Term, the Judges attended the Lord Chancellor to <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> after the uſual manner; where an Itch after things Novel, had occaſioned a Confluence of Multitudes of Perſons of all Qualities, who were impatient to hear the Succeſs and Event of the Biſhops Affair.</p>
            <p>About Nine the Court being ſate, the Attorney and Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor Generals, prayed a Rule of Court might be made, for the bringing the Lords the Biſhops up to that Bar, in order to plead to an Information they had prepared againſt them, for Contriving, Making and Publiſhing a Seditious Libel againſt His Majeſty and His Government; the which was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted, and about a quarter after Eleven, the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> (attended by ſix or ſeven Warders) brought his Priſoners into the Court, where they had Chairs placed there to ſit down, their Counſel (which were Sir <hi>Francis Pemberton,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Sawyers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Polixfin,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Finch</hi>) began to make ſome Objections againſt the Legality of their Commitment, and conſequently againſt the return of their <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and being brought into that court, the Warrant having ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as they imagined, in Form, for it run ſigned by ſuch and ſuch (to the number of about Fourteen) Lords of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Moſt Honourable Privy Council, and not by Us Lords in Council. So that they Inſinuated they did not know where that Warrant might be made, for that theſe Lords had not
<pb facs="tcp:48368:2"/>Power to Commit, nor were a Court, but as they were met in Council; but this Objection, after a long Debate managed for the King, by the Attorney and Sollicitor Generals, only was at length Over-ruled by the Judges, though Mr. Juſtice <hi>Powell</hi> ſeemed not fully to aſſent to the Opinion of his Brethren, but rather diſlike the Form of the Warrant.</p>
            <p>The Subſtance of this next Argument, was chiefly about the Dignity of their Peerage, As whether it was uſual for a Peer to be held to Bail, or Committed upon a Miſdemeanor: But this, after much Alteration by the Council on both ſides, was alſo Over-ruled by the Judges.</p>
            <p>Then the Arch-Biſhop put in a Plea, which being read, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Matter nothing different from what had been before diſcuſſed, and ſo was rejected as frivolous.</p>
            <p>Then their Council urged, they might have time allowed them to Plead to the Information; but Sir <hi>Samuel Aſtre</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring it had been the Cuſtom of that Court, for theſe twelve Years to his knowledge, (and was long before, as he had been informed by his Predeceſſors) to Plead immediate to the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.) Upon which their Lordſhips Pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> and the Court gave them till that day Fortnight to prepare for their Tryal. Every Man ſtanding upon his ſingle Recognizance, in ſuch a Sum as each voluntarily named; The Arch-Biſhop 200 <hi>l.</hi> and the other Biſhops in 100 <hi>l.</hi> each, and ſo were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from their Warders, and one attended the Arch-Biſhop to <hi>Canterbury-houſe.</hi> They had all the Civilities and Reſpect from the Court that was poſſible to be ſhewn to Perſons of their Quality; and if Bail had been required by the Court, about Twenty of the Principle Nobility attendeed to have ſerved their Lordſhips. The Court riſe at a quarter after Three, this Affair having held them in Debate three hours and a half.</p>
            <p>The People ſeemed extreamly ſatisfied at the fair play their Lordſhips and Council had had through the whole Debate; and accompanied them in great Throngs to the Parliament-Stairs, where his Grace took Barge. And in ſome Parts of the City, the People, through miſtake, thinking the Biſhops had been cleared, made Boon-fires, and gave other Signals of their Joy.</p>
